Building an autonomous vehicle simulation AI agent from scratch is an ambitious and rewarding project. This type of system involves several complex aspects, including perception, decision-making, control, and planning. To develop such an agent, you need to tackle various components like sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR), environment modeling, path planning, and reinforcement learning for decision-making.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating an autonomous vehicle simulation AI agent, focusing on perception, decision-making, and vehicle control.

### **1. Setting Up the Environment**

Before starting, you’ll need a simulation environment where you can test your AI agent. Popular choices for autonomous vehicle simulation are:

* **CARLA**: Open-source autonomous driving simulator that includes realistic traffic, weather, and vehicle dynamics.
* **Unity (with ML-Agents)**: Unity provides a customizable environment where you can simulate vehicles and interactions.
* **AirSim**: An open-source simulator from Microsoft designed for autonomous vehicles, drones, and other robotics.

We’ll assume you choose **CARLA** for this example.

---

### **2. Perception Module**

The perception module involves processing raw data from the vehicle’s sensors (camera, LIDAR, radar) to understand the surrounding environment. The main tasks are object detection (cars, pedestrians), lane detection, and obstacle avoidance.

#### **Object Detection with OpenCV**

We'll use **OpenCV** and **Deep Learning** (such as a pre-trained **YOLO** model) for object detection.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO object detector (pre-trained weights)
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getLayers()]

# Function to detect objects
def detect_objects(frame):
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outs = net.forward(output_layers)

    # Extract information from detection
    class_ids = []
    confidences = []
    boxes = []
    for out in outs:
        for detection in out:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            if confidence > 0.5:
                center_x = int(detection[0] * frame.shape[1])
                center_y = int(detection[1] * frame.shape[0])
                w = int(detection[2] * frame.shape[1])
                h = int(detection[3] * frame.shape[0])
                x = center_x - w // 2
                y = center_y - h // 2
                boxes.append([x, y, w, h])
                confidences.append(float(confidence))
                class_ids.append(class_id)

    # Apply non-maxima suppression to avoid duplicate boxes
    indexes = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)
    return boxes, class_ids, confidences

# Example of using the detection function
frame = cv2.imread("test_frame.jpg")
boxes, class_ids, confidences = detect_objects(frame)
for i in range(len(boxes)):
    x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
    cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow("Detected Objects", frame)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

* **Explanation**: This code loads a pre-trained YOLO model to detect objects such as cars, pedestrians, and other obstacles in the environment.
* **Input**: The input is a frame (image) from a camera mounted on the vehicle.
* **Output**: It returns the bounding boxes of detected objects.

### **3. Decision Making and Path Planning**

Decision-making involves determining the best course of action based on the environment (e.g., stop at traffic lights, avoid collisions). **A* Search Algorithm*\* and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** are commonly used for path planning in simpler environments.

Let’s use a basic **A* search*\* for planning a route.

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

# A* Search Algorithm for pathfinding
def a_star(start, goal, grid):
    open_list = PriorityQueue()
    open_list.put((0, start))
    came_from = {}
    g_score = {start: 0}
    f_score = {start: heuristic(start, goal)}

    while not open_list.empty():
        current = open_list.get()[1]

        if current == goal:
            return reconstruct_path(came_from, current)

        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current, grid):
            tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + 1
            if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                came_from[neighbor] = current
                g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                f_score[neighbor] = g_score[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                open_list.put((f_score[neighbor], neighbor))

    return None

# Heuristic function (Manhattan distance)
def heuristic(a, b):
    return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])

# Reconstruct the path
def reconstruct_path(came_from, current):
    path = [current]
    while current in came_from:
        current = came_from[current]
        path.append(current)
    path.reverse()
    return path

# Function to get neighbors (4 directions in a grid)
def get_neighbors(node, grid):
    x, y = node
    neighbors = [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]
    valid_neighbors = [n for n in neighbors if 0 <= n[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= n[1] < len(grid[0]) and grid[n[0]][n[1]] != 1]
    return valid_neighbors

# Example grid (0 = free space, 1 = obstacle)
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]

start = (0, 0)
goal = (3, 3)

path = a_star(start, goal, grid)
print("Path found:", path)
```

* **Explanation**: The A\* algorithm searches for the shortest path between the start and goal nodes in a grid, considering obstacles.
* **Input**: A grid representing the environment (with `1` as obstacles and `0` as free spaces).
* **Output**: The optimal path from start to goal.

---

### **4. Control and Vehicle Dynamics**

Once the path is planned, the control system needs to execute commands like steering, acceleration, and braking.

For simplicity, we'll simulate basic vehicle dynamics.

```python
import math

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, position, speed, heading):
        self.position = position  # (x, y)
        self.speed = speed  # m/s
        self.heading = heading  # degrees

    def move(self, acceleration, delta_heading):
        # Update speed and heading
        self.speed += acceleration
        self.heading += delta_heading

        # Calculate new position using basic kinematics
        self.position = (
            self.position[0] + self.speed * math.cos(math.radians(self.heading)),
            self.position[1] + self.speed * math.sin(math.radians(self.heading))
        )

    def get_position(self):
        return self.position

# Simulating the vehicle's movement
vehicle = Vehicle(position=(0, 0), speed=5, heading=0)
vehicle.move(acceleration=1, delta_heading=10)
print("Vehicle Position:", vehicle.get_position())
```

* **Explanation**: The `Vehicle` class simulates a simple vehicle that moves based on speed, heading, and acceleration.
* **Input**: Acceleration and heading change.
* **Output**: New vehicle position after movement.

### **5. Reinforcement Learning for Decision Making (Optional)**

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to optimize the vehicle's behavior in complex environments. The agent learns by interacting with the simulation and receiving rewards for performing tasks like avoiding collisions or staying on the road.

For simplicity, you can integrate RL libraries like **Stable Baselines3** to train an agent for decision-making tasks like lane-keeping or traffic navigation.

---

### **6. Integration and Simulation**

You can integrate all these components (perception, planning, control) within a simulation environment like **CARLA** or **AirSim**. These simulators provide APIs to control the vehicle, access sensor data, and simulate the environment, enabling the testing of your AI agent in real-world-like scenarios.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

In this example, we built a basic **autonomous vehicle simulation AI agent** focusing on:

* **Perception**: Using OpenCV and YOLO for object detection.
* **Decision-making**: Using the A\* algorithm for path planning.
* **Control**: Simulating basic vehicle dynamics.

This is a foundational structure. You can further enhance the system by adding:

* More sophisticated planning algorithms (e.g., DDP, MPC).
* Sensor fusion (combining data from camera, LIDAR, radar).
* Reinforcement learning for dynamic decision-making.
